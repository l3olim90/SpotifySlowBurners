# Spotify Slow Burners

This project was done with a team as part of the IS5126 module in NUS. 

The project aims to find features which contribute to a song being a "slow burner", by this project's definiton, lasting more than 3 months. A Logistics Classification coupled with s custom 2SLS model found that acousticness, energy and speechiness can be causes of a track to be classified as a "fast-burner".
